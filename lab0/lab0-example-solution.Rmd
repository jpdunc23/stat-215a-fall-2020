Note that in a real lab you will be expected to write a full publication-quality report. This pretend lab simply was purposed to give you an idea about how to use R to load in data, create visualizations and get a taste of the tidyverse.

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# set knitr options globally
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,  # don't print code
  warning = FALSE,  # don't print warnings
  message = FALSE  # don't print messages
)

# load in libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r load-data}

# read in USArrests data
data(USArrests)
# uncomment to read more about USArrests dataset
# ? USArrests

# read in state coordinates data
state_coordinates <- read.table(here("lab0/data/stateCoord.txt"))

```


```{r clean-data}

arrests <- USArrests %>% 
  # convert rownames to a column named "state"
  rownames_to_column("state") %>%
  # convert all variable names to lowercase words separated by _
  select(state = state, 
         murder = Murder, 
         assault = Assault, 
         urban_pop = UrbanPop, 
         rape = Rape)


state_coordinates <- state_coordinates %>% 
  # convert rownames to a column named state
  rownames_to_column("state") %>%
  # remove hyphens from state names
  mutate(state = gsub("-", " ", state))

# check to see which state names don't match
setdiff(arrests$state, state_coordinates$state)
# or equivalently,
arrests$state[!(arrests$state %in% state_coordinates$state)]

```


```{r join-data}
# merge the datasets together (could also use a _join() function)
arrests <- left_join(arrests, state_coordinates, by = "state")
if (nrow(arrests) != nrow(USArrests)) {
  stop("The merge between the arrests and state locations failed.")
}
```



```{r plt-murder-vs-assault}
# There is a positive correlation between murder and assault rates.
ggplot(arrests) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = murder, y = assault), size=4) +
  xlab("Murder Arrests (per 100,000)") +
  ylab("Assault Arrests (per 100,000)")
```

```{r plt-outlier}
# There is an outlier in the relationship between urban population and
# rate of rape. Identify the outlier
arrests <- arrests %>% 
  # create outlier column
  mutate(outlier = if_else(rape > 0.75 * urban_pop, "Outlier", "Normal"))
# plot the data with the outlier colored
ggplot(arrests) +
  geom_point(aes(x = urban_pop, y = rape, color = outlier),
             size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Urban Population (%)", y = "Rape Arrests (per 100,000)",
       color = "Outlier")
  
```



```{r plt-txt}
# What is that outlier?  It is Alaska, those jerks.
ggplot(arrests) +
  geom_text(aes(x = urban_pop, y = rape, 
                label = state, color = outlier)) +
  labs(x = "Urban Population (%)", y = "Rape Arrests (per 100,000)",
       color = "Outlier")
```
