\section{Hypothesis testing, the $t$-distribution}

Imagine we observe $(x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{n},y_{n})$ where $(x_{i},y_{i})$
are multivariate normal with mean $(\mu_{x},\mu_{y})$, $Var(x_{i})=Var(y_{i})=\sigma^{2}$
and correlation $\rho$. We are interested in testing the null hypothesis
that $\mu_{x}=\mu_{y}$.

Under the null hypothesis we know 
\[
t=\frac{(\bar{x}-\bar{y})}{s_{pooled}\sqrt{2/n}}
\]
is distributed as a Student's $t$ with $2n-2$ degrees of freedom, where $s_{pooled}$ is the pooled sample standard deviation. See any
undergraduate text (or Wikipedia page ``Student's t-test'')
if you are unfamiliar with the $t$ distribution.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write $s_{pooled}$ in terms of $x_{i},y_{i},\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$
(this is a standard definition)
\item What is the expectation of $s_{pooled}^{2}$? 
\item The statement above (on the t-statistic) isn't quite right. Are any
additional assumptions needed? 
\end{enumerate}
Consider doing a paired t-test with the same data. The test statistic
here is 
\[
t_{paired}=\frac{(\bar{x}-\bar{y})}{s_{\textit{diff}}\sqrt{1/n}}.
\]
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Write $s_{\textit{diff}}$ in terms of $x_{i},y_{i},\bar{x}$ and
$\bar{y}$. (another standard definition)
\item What distribution does $t_{paired}$ have?
\item What is the expectation of $s_{\textit{diff}}^{2}$? 
\item Compare $s_{\textit{diff}}^{2}\frac{1}{n}$ to $s_{pooled}^{2}\frac{2}{n}$.
When is $s_{\textit{diff}}^{2}\frac{1}{n}<s_{pooled}^{2}\frac{2}{n}$?
When is $E(s_{\textit{diff}}^{2}\frac{1}{n})<E(s_{pooled}^{2}\frac{2}{n})$? 
\item From these computations, what do you learn? 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Questions from Freedman}

In Freedman, do questions 1 - 5 and 9 starting on page 13. This may
sound like a lot of work. However, once you do the reading, each question
should have a straight-forward answer.

Please look into the following map: \url{http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowmap1_1854_lge.htm}.
This is the map made by John Snow regarding the Broad Street pump.
Each small block marks a cholera patient.
\begin{itemize}
\item How would you transform this display into numerical measures? 
\item What would be gained quantifying the effects? What would be lost? 
\end{itemize}
