# to do:
# 1) Pick two (or more) regression methods and an error metric
# 2) Split the data into training/validation/test splits
# 3) On the training set, use CV to tune hyperparameters for each method under consideration
# 4) Evaluate the tuned methods on the validation set
# 5) Report the test error of your "best" method
# 6) Time permitting, repeat steps 2-5 B times to get a variance estimate
# 7) Time permitting, perform EDA to "diagnose" the errors - are there any observations that are particularly difficult to predict? Any common mistakes?
